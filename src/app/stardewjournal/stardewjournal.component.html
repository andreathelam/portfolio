            <h5><mark><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></mark></h5>
            <p><strong>Stardew Valley is an open-world RPG</strong> where players play as a corporate-employee-turned-farmer that has inherited their grandfather’s land in Pelican Town. The entertaining storyline and quests and adorable pixel-art sucked me in, and soon, this game became my obsession but also a source of <strong>stress</strong>.</p>
            <p>As a virgo-rising, I had the urge to <strong>plan every activity and detail</strong> of my days within the game. However, each day was only 15 minutes long in real-time, so this resulted in many <strong>unorganized scribbles on post-it notes</strong> and me frantically googling the hours of Robin’s shop before time was up. So, I wanted to see if other players faced the same problems as me and to figure out a solution.</p>
            <p><strong>Stardew Journal is a management app tool</strong> specifically to help players <strong>plan and manage their gameplay</strong>. The goal is to gather all Stardew Valley <strong>materials and information in one place</strong> for users to easily personalize and <strong>create lists</strong> that cater towards their needs.</p>

        <h4><mark>Survey</mark></h4>
        <p>To understand the perspectives and needs from other players, I conducted a survey and posted it on the Stardew Valley subreddit. The responses I received covered a wide range of players from the console, mobile, and pc platforms and from people who have been playing for 2 months to 4 years. </p>
        <h3>What I learned from the Survey</h3>

        <br>
        <h4><mark>Personas</mark></h4>
        <p>Asking for the processes players used when planning their tasks and managing their farms, I categorized the responses into 3 general groups based on what aspect of the game is focused on and the players’ needs. These are the crafted personas.</p>

        <h3>What I learned from the Personas</h3>
        <p>With so many aspects of the game players can focus on, there were a variety of wants and needs. However, the most common need was the use of lists to plan and organize their gameplay. Therefore, I focused on incorporating the ability to create multiple types of lists and the flexibility to group and customize those lists. Moreover, nearly all survey participants referred to the Stardew Wiki page for gameplay information such as bundle items and NPC likes/dislikes; therefore, I planned to include that information directly on the application.</p>

        <h4><mark>Task Flow</mark></h4>
        <p>By visualizing the tasks the user should be able to do when using the application, I created two task flows to identify and understand how the user would navigate through Stardew Journal.
            This acted as a guide for determining the functional requirements and the navigational links for the wireframes.

        <h4><mark>Takeaways</mark></h4>
        <p>As I was transitioning from the low-fi wireframes to hi-fi wireframes, I referred back to the task flows often. This taught me the importance of planning the interactions and decisions the user can take, in order to determine the key pages for the application. Since this application was designed to be a flexible management tool, there were many different approaches to how list data could be displayed, and the design I created was aimed to have a balance of flexibility and some structure. My next steps would be to conduct user testing to determine whether the flow of the application is understandable and familiar.
