            <p>"How much water should I give her? Is the room humidity ok?" As aspiring plant owners, Lisa and I realized the difficulties of plant care, but we found that the responsibility of nuturing another living being contributed to our self-improvement and self-growth.</p>
            <p>So...we envisioned a <strong>plant delivery service</strong> with a <strong>mobile application</strong> that helps people manage and organize their plant family, along with providing the necessary information needed to care for each plant. </p>
            <p>Grow is subscription-based service that sends customers a new plant on a set basis and <strong>provides the resources</strong> to support the optimal well-being of their plants. The goal is to cultivate <strong> feelings of empowerment</strong> through the <strong>nurturing of plants</strong>.</p>

            <hr>    
        </div>

        <p>When conducting my research, I wanted to understand the motivation behind people who are passionate about plant care and to learn how people, who own multiple plants, take care of their green family.</p>
        <h4><mark><u>Method: Contextual Inquiry</u></mark></h4>
        <p><em>Key Research Question</em></p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.0;"><strong><em>What challenges do people who own a lot of plants have when organizing and tracking the care for each plant?</em></strong></h2>
        <p>To design the mobile tool, I observed a participant in their daily morning plant care routine. The participant had 16 plants that were accumulated over the past year, and she had intermediate knowledge in taking care of plants.</p>
        
        <br>

        <h3>What I learned from the Contextual Inquiry</h3>
        <p>The participant used the Notes app on her iPhone to track and manage all of her plants. She had found the plant care information from various online resources and recorded it down everytime she added a new plant to her collection. The information included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>how often the plant should be watered and the last date it was watered</li>
            <li>the amount of sunlight it should have</li>
            <li>the type of environment and humidity it likes</li>
            <li>any additional notes such as best seasons for fertilization</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The participant described her process as “tedious and time-consuming” and wanted a more quick method in attaining the care instructions for her plants and organizing her plants based on categories.</p>
        <h4><mark><u><strong>Persona</strong></u></mark></h4>
        <p>With what I learned from my research, I created a persona of my target user. I used this to focus the app on satisfying the user’s needs.</p>

        <p>As my first UI project, I have a clearer understanding of the design processes and the importance of user research for the final elements implemented in the design. Since this was a project that was personal to me, I am proud of the outcome. The next steps would be to carry out further testing to refine the prototypes.</p>
